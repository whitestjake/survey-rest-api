to try this out clone the repo and open using your favorite java coding software, I use eclipse personally

run the file from src/main/java/com.in28minutes.springboot.restapi/RestApiApplication.java

use localhost:8080 to access information and see the layout

localhost:8080/surverys/Survey1 for cleanest layout

this applications main focus to is to demonstrate using proper RESTful api formatting

this application also has some demonstration for using JUnit testing
